# Java-Simple-Xml-Serialization
A library to do a simple serialization from/to objects.

The aim of this library is to achieve simple serialization of Java objects into XML file. The XML
file contains only object data, no meta-data about classes. The data types are derived from the instances
which should be filled. Then, it is very easy to change XMl file content without disrupting the file to not be loadable.
On the other side, as the data types are derived from the instance which is filled, there is no type control, only
content control.

Currently the project is in the early *alpha* stage and supports only partial parsing.

For exact description see project wiki.
